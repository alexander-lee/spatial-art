# Facial Shift - Processing Project

### Description
This project was an attempt at both playing around with the idea of [data moshing](http://datamoshing.com/), and using it to convey a message about our perception of ourselves through social media. The premise of the project uses your webcam to display noisy background, only to be covered with small clear "screens" of yourself. It uses [optical flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_flow) to detect movement and depending on the amount of movement, it will cause a glitch-effect on your screen. With enough movement, you can shrug off the "screens".
